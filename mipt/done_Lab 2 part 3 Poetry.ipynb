to say, within thine own deep sunken eyes,\\n  were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.\\n  how much more praise deserv'd thy beauty's use,\\n  if thou couldst answer 'this fair child of mine\\n  shall sum my count, and make my old excuse,'\\n  proving his beauty by succession thine!\\n    this were to be new made when thou art old,\\n    and see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it

legacy?\\n  nature's bequest gives nothing, but doth lend,\\n  and being frank she lends to those are free:\\n  then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse\\n  the bounteous largess given thee to give?\\n  profitless usurer, why dost thou use\\n  so great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?\\n  for having traffic with thy self alone,\\n  thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive:\\n  then

hours, that with gentle work did frame\\n  the lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,\\n  will play the tyrants to the very same\\n  and that unfair which fairly doth excel;\\n  for never-resting time leads summer on\\n  to hideous winter, and confounds him there;\\n  sap checked with frost, and lusty leaves quite gone,\\n  beauty o'er-snowed and bareness every where:\\n  then were not summer's distillation left,\\n  a liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,\\n  beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,\\n  nor it, nor no remembrance what it was:\\n    but flowers distill'd, though they with winter meet,\\n    leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.\\n\\n\\n  vi\\n\\n  then let not winter's ragged hand deface,\\n  in thee thy summer, ere thou be distill'd:\\n

do if thou shouldst depart,\\n  leaving thee living in posterity?\\n    be not self-will'd, for thou art much too fair\\n    to be death's conquest and make worms thine heir.\\n\\n  vii\\n\\n  lo! in the orient when the gracious light\\n  lifts up his burning head, each under eye\\n  doth homage to his new-appearing sight,\\n  serving with looks his sacred majesty;\\n  and having climb'd the steep-up heavenly hill,\\n  resembling strong youth in his middle age,\\n  yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,\\n  attending on his golden pilgrimage:\\n  but when from highmost pitch, with weary car,\\n  like feeble age, he reeleth from the day,\\n  the eyes, 'fore duteous, now converted are\\n  from his low tract, and look another way:\\n    so thou, thyself outgoing in thy noon:\\n    unlook'd, on diest unless thou get a son.\\n\\n  viii\\n\\n  music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly?\\n  sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy:\\n  why lov'st thou that which thou receiv'st not gladly,\\n  or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy?\\n  if the true concord of well-tuned sounds,\\n  by unions married, do offend thine ear,\\n  they do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds\\n  in singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear.\\n  mark how one string, sweet husband to another,\\n  strikes each in each by mutual ordering;\\n  resembling sire and child and happy mother,\\n  who, all in one, one pleasing note do sing:\\n    whose speechless song being many, seeming one,\\n    sings this to thee: 'thou single wilt prove none.'\\n\\n  ix\\n\\n  is it for fear to wet a widow's eye,\\n  that thou consum'st thy self in single life?\\n  ah! if thou issueless shalt hap to die,\\n  the world will wail thee like a makeless wife;\\n  the world will be thy widow and still weep\\n  that thou no form of thee hast left behind,\\n  when every private widow well may keep\\n  by children's eyes, her husband's shape in mind:\\n  look! what an unthrift in the world doth spend\\n  shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;\\n  but beauty's waste hath in the world an end,\\n  and kept unused the user so destroys it.\\n    no love toward others in that bosom sits\\n    that on himself such murd'rous shame commits.\\n\\n  x\\n\\n  for shame! deny that thou bear'st love to any,\\n  who for thy self art so unprovident.\\n  grant, if thou wilt, thou art belov'd of many,\\n  but that thou none lov'st is most evident:\\n  for thou art so possess'd with murderous hate,\\n  that 'gainst thy self thou stick'st not to conspire,\\n  seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate\\n  which to repair should be thy chief desire.\\n  o! change thy thought, that i may change my mind:\\n  shall hate be fairer lodg'd than gentle love?\\n  be, as thy presence is, gracious and kind,\\n  or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove:\\n    make thee another self for love of me,\\n    that beauty still may live in thine or thee.\\n\\n  xi\\n\\n  as fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou grow'st,\\n  in one of thine, from that which thou departest;\\n  and that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow'st,\\n  thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest,\\n  herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase;\\n  without this folly, age, and cold decay:\\n  if all were minded so, the times should cease\\n  and threescore year would make the world away.\\n  let those whom nature hath not made for store,\\n  harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish:\\n  look, whom she best endow'd, she gave thee more;\\n  which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:\\n    she carv'd thee for her seal, and meant thereby,\\n    thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.\\n\\n  xii\\n\\n  when i do count the clock that tells the time,\\n  and see the brave day sunk in hideous night;\\n  when i behold the violet past prime,\\n  and sable curls, all silvered o'er with white;\\n  when lofty trees i see barren of leaves,\\n  which erst from heat did canopy the herd,\\n  and summer's green all girded up in sheaves,\\n  borne on the bier with white and bristly beard,\\n  then of thy beauty do i question make,\\n  that thou among the wastes of time must go,\\n  since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake\\n  and die as fast as they see others grow;\\n    and nothing 'gainst time's scythe can make defence\\n    save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence.\\n\\n  xiii\\n\\n  o! that you were your self; but, love you are\\n  no longer yours, than you your self here live:\\n  against this coming end you should prepare,\\n  and your sweet semblance to some other give:\\n  so should that beauty which you hold in lease\\n  find no determination; then you were\\n  yourself again, after yourself's decease,\\n  when your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.\\n  who lets so fair a house fall to decay,\\n  which husbandry in honour might uphold,\\n  against the stormy gusts of winter's day\\n  and barren rage of death's eternal cold?\\n    o! none but unthrifts. dear my love, you know,\\n    you had a father: let your son say so.\\n\\n  xiv\\n\\n  not from the stars do i my judgement pluck;\\n  and yet methinks i have astronomy,\\n  but not to tell of good or evil luck,\\n  of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality;\\n  nor can i fortune to brief minutes tell,\\n  pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,\\n  or say with princes if it shall go well\\n  by oft predict that i in heaven find:\\n  but from thine eyes my knowledge i derive,\\n  and constant stars in them i read such art\\n  as 'truth and beauty shall together thrive,\\n  if from thyself, to store thou wouldst convert';\\n    or else of thee this i prognosticate:\\n    'thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.'\\n\\n  xv\\n\\n  when i consider every thing that grows\\n  holds in perfection but a little moment,\\n  that this huge stage presenteth nought but shows\\n  whereon the stars in secret influence comment;\\n  when i perceive that men as plants increase,\\n  cheered and checked even by the self-same sky,\\n  vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,\\n  and wear their brave state out of memory;\\n  then the conceit of this inconstant stay\\n  sets you most rich in youth before my sight,\\n  where wasteful time debateth with decay\\n  to change your day of youth to sullied night,\\n    and all in war with time for love of you,\\n    as he takes from you, i engraft you new.\\n\\n  xvi\\n\\n  but wherefore do not you a mightier way\\n  make war upon this bloody tyrant, time?\\n  and fortify your self in your decay\\n  with means more blessed than my barren rhyme?\\n  now stand you on the top of happy hours,\\n  and many maiden gardens, yet unset,\\n  with virtuous wish would bear you living flowers,\\n  much liker than your painted counterfeit:\\n  so should the lines of life that life repair,\\n  which this, time's pencil, or my pupil pen,\\n  neither in inward worth nor outward fair,\\n  can make you live your self in eyes of men.\\n    to give away yourself, keeps yourself still,\\n    and you must live, drawn by your own sweet skill.\\n\\n  xvii\\n\\n  who will believe my verse in time to come,\\n  if it were fill'd with your most high deserts?\\n  though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb\\n  which hides your life, and shows not half your parts.\\n  if i could write the beauty of your eyes,\\n  and in fresh numbers number all your graces,\\n  the age to come would say 'this poet lies;\\n  such heavenly touches ne'er touch'd earthly faces.'\\n  so should my papers, yellow'd with their age,\\n  be scorn'd, like old men of less truth than tongue,\\n  and your true rights be term'd a poet's rage\\n  and stretched metre of an antique song:\\n    but were some child of yours alive that time,\\n    you should live twice,--in it, and in my rhyme.\\n\\n  xviii\\n\\n  shall i compare thee to a summer's day?\\n  thou art more lovely and more temperate:\\n  rough winds do shake the darling buds of may,\\n  and summer's lease hath all too short a date:\\n  sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,\\n  and often is his gold complexion dimm'd,\\n  and every fair from fair sometime declines,\\n  by chance, or nature's changing course untrimm'd:\\n  but thy eternal summer shall not fade,\\n  nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,\\n  nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,\\n  when in eternal lines to time thou grow'st,\\n    so long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,\\n    so long lives this, and this gives life to thee.\\n\\n  xix\\n\\n  devouring time, blunt thou the lion's paws,\\n  and make the earth devour her own sweet brood;\\n  pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,\\n  and burn the long-liv'd phoenix, in her blood;\\n  make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets,\\n  and do whate'er thou wilt, swift-footed time,\\n  to the wide world and all her fading sweets;\\n  but i forbid thee one most heinous crime:\\n  o! carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow,\\n  nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen;\\n  him in thy course untainted do allow\\n  for beauty's pattern to succeeding men.\\n    yet, do thy worst old time: despite thy wrong,\\n    my love shall in my verse ever live young.\\n\\n  xx\\n\\n  a woman's face with nature's own hand painted,\\n  hast thou, the master mistress of my passion;\\n  a woman's gentle heart, but not acquainted\\n  with shifting change, as is false women's fashion:\\n  an eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling,\\n  gilding the object whereupon it gazeth;\\n  a man in hue all 'hues' in his controlling,\\n  which steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth.\\n  and for a woman wert thou first created;\\n  till nature, as she wrought thee, fell a-doting,\\n  and by addition me of thee defeated,\\n  by adding one thing to my purpose nothing.\\n    but since she prick'd thee out for women's pleasure,\\n    mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure.\\n\\n  xxi\\n\\n  so is it not with me as with that muse,\\n  stirr'd by a painted beauty to his verse,\\n  who heaven itself for ornament doth use\\n  and every fair with his fair doth rehearse,\\n  making a couplement of proud compare.\\n  with sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems,\\n  with april's first-born flowers, and all things rare,\\n  that heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.\\n  o! let me, true in love, but truly write,\\n  and then believe me, my love is as fair\\n  as any mother's child, though not so bright\\n  as those gold candles fix'd in heaven's air:\\n    let them say more that like of hearsay well;\\n    i will not praise that purpose not to sell.\\n\\n  xxii\\n\\n  my glass shall not persuade me i am old,\\n  so long as youth and thou are of one date;\\n  but when in thee time's furrows i behold,\\n  then look i death my days should expiate.\\n  for all that beauty that doth cover thee,\\n  is but the seemly raiment of my heart,\\n  which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me:\\n  how can i then be elder than thou art?\\n  o! therefore love, be of thyself so wary\\n  as i, not for myself, but for thee will;\\n  bearing thy heart, which i will keep so chary\\n  as tender nurse her babe from faring ill.\\n    presume not on thy heart when mine is slain,\\n    thou gav'st me thine not to give back again.\\n\\n  xxiii\\n\\n  as an unperfect actor on the stage,\\n  who with his fear is put beside his part,\\n  or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,\\n  whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart;\\n  so i, for fear of trust, forget to say\\n  the perfect ceremony of love's rite,\\n  and in mine own love's strength seem to decay,\\n  o'ercharg'd with burthen of mine own love's might.\\n  o! let my looks be then the eloquence\\n  and dumb presagers of my speaking breast,\\n  who plead for love, and look for recompense,\\n  more than that tongue that more hath more express'd.\\n    o! learn to read what silent love hath writ:\\n    to hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit.\\n\\n  xxiv\\n\\n  mine eye hath play'd the painter and hath stell'd,\\n  thy beauty's form in table of my heart;\\n  my body is the frame wherein 'tis held,\\n  and perspective it is best painter's art.\\n  for through the painter must you see his skill,\\n  to find where your true image pictur'd lies,\\n  which in my bosom's shop is hanging still,\\n  that hath his windows glazed with thine eyes.\\n  now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done:\\n  mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me\\n  are windows to my breast, where-through the sun\\n  delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;\\n    yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art,\\n    they draw but what they see, know not the heart.\\n\\n  xxv\\n\\n  let those who are in favour with their stars\\n  of public honour and proud titles boast,\\n  whilst i, whom fortune of such triumph bars\\n  unlook'd for joy in that i honour most.\\n  great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread\\n  but as the marigold at the sun's eye,\\n  and in themselves their pride lies buried,\\n  for at a frown they in their glory

of thine\\n  in thy soul's thought, all naked, will bestow it:\\n  till whatsoever star that guides my moving,\\n  points on me graciously with fair aspect,\\n  and puts apparel on my tatter'd loving,\\n  to show me worthy of thy sweet respect:\\n    then may i dare to boast how i do love thee;\\n    till then, not show my head where thou mayst prove me.\\n\\n  xxvii\\n\\n  weary with toil,

where i abide--\\n  intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,\\n  and keep my drooping eyelids open wide,\\n  looking on darkness which the blind do see:\\n  save that my soul's imaginary sight\\n  presents thy shadow to my sightless view,\\n  which, like a jewel hung in ghastly night,\\n  makes black night beauteous, and her old face new.\\n    lo! thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind,\\n    for thee, and for myself, no quiet find.\\n\\n  xxviii\\n\\n  how can i then return in happy plight,\\n  that am debarre'd the benefit of rest?\\n  when day's oppression is not eas'd by night,\\n  but day by night and night by day oppress'd,\\n  and each, though enemies to either's reign,\\n  do in consent shake hands to torture me,\\n  the one by toil, the other to complain\\n  how far i toil, still farther off from thee.\\n  i tell the day, to please him thou art bright,\\n  and dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven:\\n  so flatter i the swart-complexion'd night,\\n  when sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even.\\n    but day doth daily draw my sorrows longer,\\n    and night doth nightly make grief's length seem stronger.\\n\\n  xxix\\n\\n  when in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes\\n  i all alone beweep my outcast state,\\n  and trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,\\n  and look upon myself, and curse my fate,\\n  wishing me like to one more rich in hope,\\n  featur'd like him, like him with friends possess'd,\\n  desiring this man's art, and that man's scope,\\n  with what i most enjoy contented least;\\n  yet in these thoughts my self almost despising,\\n  haply i think on thee,-- and then my state,\\n  like to the lark at break of day arising\\n  from sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate;\\n    for thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings\\n    that then i scorn to change my state with kings.\\n\\n  xxx\\n\\n  when to the sessions of sweet silent thought\\n  i summon up remembrance of things past,\\n  i sigh the lack of many a thing i sought,\\n  and with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:\\n  then can i drown an eye, unused to flow,\\n  for precious friends hid in death's dateless night,\\n  and weep afresh love's long since cancell'd woe,\\n  and moan the expense of many a vanish'd sight:\\n  then can i grieve at grievances foregone,\\n  and heavily from woe to woe tell o'er\\n  the sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,\\n  which i new pay as if not paid before.\\n    but if the while i think on thee, dear friend,\\n    all losses are restor'd and sorrows end.\\n\\n  xxxi\\n\\n  thy bosom is endeared with all hearts,\\n  which i by lacking have supposed dead;\\n  and there reigns love, and all love's loving parts,\\n  and all those friends which i thought buried.\\n  how many a holy and obsequious tear\\n  hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye,\\n  as interest of the dead, which now appear\\n  but things remov'd that hidden in thee lie!\\n  thou art the grave where buried love doth live,\\n  hung with the trophies of my lovers gone,\\n  who all their parts of me to thee did give,\\n  that due of many now is thine alone:\\n    their images i lov'd, i view in thee,\\n    and thou--all they--hast all the all of me.\\n\\n  xxxii\\n\\n  if thou survive my well-contented day,\\n  when that churl death my bones with dust shall cover\\n  and shalt by fortune once more re-survey\\n  these poor rude lines of thy deceased lover,\\n  compare them with the bett'ring of the time,\\n  and though they be outstripp'd by every pen,\\n  reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,\\n  exceeded by the height of happier men.\\n  o! then vouchsafe me but this loving thought:\\n  'had my friend's muse grown with this growing age,\\n  a dearer birth than this his love had brought,\\n  to march in ranks of better equipage:\\n    but since he died and poets better prove,\\n    theirs for their style i'll read, his for his love'.\\n\\n  xxxiii\\n\\n  full many a glorious

all triumphant splendour on my brow;\\n  but out! alack! he was but one hour mine,\\n  the region cloud hath mask'd him from me now.\\n    yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth;\\n    suns of the world may stain when heaven's sun staineth.\\n\\n  xxxiv\\n\\n  why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,\\n  and make me travel forth without my cloak,\\n  to let base clouds o'ertake me in my way,\\n  hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke?\\n  'tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,\\n  to dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,\\n  for no man well of such a salve can speak,\\n  that heals the wound, and cures not the disgrace:\\n  nor can thy shame give physic to my grief;\\n  though thou repent, yet i have still the loss:\\n  the offender's sorrow lends but weak relief\\n  to him that bears the strong offence's cross.\\n    ah! but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,\\n    and they are rich and ransom all ill deeds.\\n\\n  xxxv\\n\\n  no more be griev'd at that

thy adverse party is thy advocate,--\\n  and 'gainst myself a lawful plea commence:\\n  such civil war is in my love and hate,\\n    that i an accessary needs must be,\\n    to that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.\\n\\n  xxxvi\\n\\n  let me confess that we two must be twain,\\n  although our undivided loves are one:\\n  so shall those blots that do with me remain,\\n  without thy help, by me be borne alone.\\n  in our two loves there is but one respect,\\n  though in our lives a separable spite,\\n  which though it alter not love's sole effect,\\n  yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight.\\n  i may not evermore acknowledge thee,\\n  lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,\\n  nor thou with public kindness honour me,\\n  unless thou take that honour from thy name:\\n    but do not so, i love thee in such sort,\\n    as thou being mine, mine is thy good report.\\n\\n  xxxvii\\n\\n  as a decrepit father takes delight\\n  to see his active child do deeds of youth,\\n  so i, made lame by fortune's dearest spite,\\n  take all my comfort of thy worth and truth;\\n  for whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit,\\n  or any of these all, or all, or more,\\n  entitled in thy parts, do crowned sit,\\n  i make my love engrafted, to this store:\\n  so then i am not lame, poor, nor despis'd,\\n  whilst that this shadow doth such substance give\\n  that i in

receiving nought by elements so slow\\n    but heavy tears, badges of either's woe.\\n\\n  xlv\\n\\n  the other two, slight air, and purging fire\\n  are both with thee, wherever i abide;\\n  the

him dost lie,--\\n  a closet never pierc'd with crystal eyes--\\n  but the defendant doth that plea deny,\\n  and says in him thy fair appearance lies.\\n  to side this title is impannelled\\n  a quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart;\\n  and by their verdict is determined\\n  the clear eye's moiety, and the dear heart's part:\\n    as thus; mine eye's due is thy outward part,\\n    and my heart's right, thy inward love of heart.\\n\\n  xlvii\\n\\n  betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took,\\n  and each doth good turns now unto the other:\\n  when that mine eye is famish'd for a

guest,\\n  and in his thoughts of love doth share a part:\\n  so, either by thy picture or my love,\\n  thy self away, art present still with me;\\n  for thou not farther than my thoughts canst move,\\n  and i am still with them, and they with thee;\\n    or, if they sleep, thy picture in my sight\\n    awakes my heart, to heart's and eye's delight.\\n\\n  xlviii\\n\\n  how careful was i when i took my way,\\n  each trifle under truest bars to thrust,\\n  that to my use it might unused stay\\n  from hands of falsehood, in sure wards of trust!\\n  but thou, to whom my jewels trifles

where thou art not, though i feel thou art,\\n  within the gentle closure of my breast,\\n  from whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part;\\n    and even thence thou wilt be stol'n i fear,\\n    for truth proves thievish for a prize so dear.\\n\\n  xlix\\n\\n  against that time, if ever that time come,\\n  when i shall see thee frown on my defects,\\n  when as thy love hath cast his utmost sum,\\n  call'd to that audit by advis'd respects;\\n  against that time when thou shalt strangely pass,\\n  and scarcely greet me with that sun, thine eye,\\n  when love, converted from the thing it was,\\n  shall reasons find of settled gravity;\\n  against that time do i ensconce me here,\\n  within the knowledge of mine own desert,\\n  and this my hand, against my self uprear,\\n  to guard the lawful reasons on thy part:\\n    to leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws,\\n    since why to love i can allege no cause.\\n\\n  l\\n\\n  how heavy do i journey on the way,\\n  when what i seek, my weary travel's end,\\n  doth teach that ease and that repose to say,\\n  'thus far the miles are measured from thy friend!'\\n  the beast that bears me, tired with my woe,\\n  plods dully on, to bear that weight in me,\\n  as if by some instinct the wretch did know\\n  his rider lov'd not speed, being made from thee:\\n  the bloody spur cannot provoke him on,\\n  that sometimes anger thrusts into his hide,\\n  which heavily he answers with a groan,\\n  more sharp to me than spurring to his side;\\n    for that same groan doth put this in my mind,\\n    my grief lies onward, and my joy behind.\\n\\n  li\\n\\n  thus can my love excuse the slow offence\\n  of my dull bearer when from thee i speed:\\n  from where thou art why should i haste me thence?\\n  till i return, of posting is no need.\\n  o! what excuse will my poor beast then find,\\n  when swift extremity can seem but slow?\\n  then should i spur, though mounted on the wind,\\n  in winged speed no motion shall i know,\\n  then can no horse with my desire keep pace;\\n  therefore desire, of perfect'st love being made,\\n  shall neigh--no dull flesh--in his fiery race;\\n  but love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade,--\\n    'since from thee going, he went wilful-slow,\\n    towards thee i'll run, and give him leave to go.'\\n\\n  lii\\n\\n  so am i as the rich, whose blessed key,\\n  can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure,\\n  the which he will not every hour survey,\\n  for blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure.\\n  therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare,\\n  since, seldom coming in that long year set,\\n  like stones of worth they thinly placed are,\\n  or captain jewels in the carcanet.\\n  so is the time that keeps you as my chest,\\n  or as the wardrobe which the robe doth

beggar'd of blood to blush through lively veins?\\n  for she hath no exchequer now but his,\\n  and proud of many, lives upon his gains.\\n    o! him she stores, to show what wealth she had\\n    in days long since, before these last so bad.\\n\\n  lxviii\\n\\n  thus is his cheek the map of days outworn,\\n  when beauty lived and died as flowers do now,\\n  before these bastard signs of fair were born,\\n  or durst inhabit on a living brow;\\n  before the golden tresses of the dead,\\n  the right of sepulchres, were shorn away,\\n  to live a second life on second head;\\n  ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay:\\n  in him those holy antique hours are seen,\\n  without all ornament, itself and true,\\n  making no summer of another's green,\\n  robbing no old to dress his beauty new;\\n    and him as for a map doth nature store,\\n    to show false art what beauty was of yore.\\n\\n  lxix\\n\\n  those parts of thee that the world's eye doth view\\n  want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend;\\n  all tongues--the voice of souls--give thee that due,\\n  uttering bare truth, even so as foes commend.\\n  thy outward thus with outward praise is crown'd;\\n  but those same tongues, that give thee so thine own,\\n  in other accents do this praise confound\\n  by seeing farther than the eye hath shown.\\n  they look into the beauty of thy mind,\\n  and that in guess they measure by thy deeds;\\n  then--churls--their thoughts, although their eyes were kind,\\n  to thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds:\\n    but why thy odour matcheth not thy show,\\n    the soil is this, that thou dost common grow.\\n\\n  lxx\\n\\n  that thou art blam'd shall not be thy defect,\\n  for slander's mark was ever yet the fair;\\n  the ornament of beauty is suspect,\\n  a crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air.\\n  so thou be good, slander doth but approve\\n  thy worth the greater being woo'd of time;\\n  for canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,\\n  and thou present'st a pure unstained prime.\\n  thou hast passed by the ambush of young days\\n  either not assail'd, or victor being charg'd;\\n  yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,\\n  to tie up envy, evermore enlarg'd,\\n    if some suspect of ill mask'd not thy show,\\n    then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe.\\n\\n  lxxi\\n\\n  no longer mourn for me when i am dead\\n  than you shall hear the surly sullen bell\\n  give warning to the world that i am fled\\n  from this vile world with vilest worms to dwell:\\n  nay, if you read this line, remember not\\n  the hand that writ it, for i love you so,\\n  that i in your sweet thoughts would be forgot,\\n  if thinking on me then should make you woe.\\n  o! if,--i say you look upon this verse,\\n  when i perhaps compounded am with clay,\\n  do not so much as my poor name rehearse;\\n  but let your love even with my life decay;\\n    lest the wise world should look into your moan,\\n    and mock you with me after i am gone.\\n\\n  lxxii\\n\\n  o! lest the world should task you to recite\\n  what merit lived in me, that you should love\\n  after my death,--dear love, forget me quite,\\n  for you in me can nothing worthy prove;\\n  unless you would devise some virtuous lie,\\n  to do more for me than mine own desert,\\n  and hang more praise upon deceased i\\n  than niggard truth would willingly impart:\\n  o! lest your true love may seem false in this\\n  that you for love speak well of me untrue,\\n  my name be buried where my body is,\\n  and live no more to shame nor me nor you.\\n    for i am shamed by that which i bring forth,\\n    and so should you, to love things nothing worth.\\n\\n  lxxiii\\n\\n  that time of year thou mayst in me behold\\n  when yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang\\n  upon those boughs which shake against the cold,\\n  bare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.\\n  in me thou see'st the twilight of such day\\n  as after sunset fadeth in the west;\\n  which by and by black night doth take away,\\n  death's second self, that seals up all in rest.\\n  in me thou see'st the glowing of such fire,\\n  that on the ashes of his youth doth lie,\\n  as the death-bed, whereon it must expire,\\n  consum'd with that which it was nourish'd by.\\n    this thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong,\\n    to love that well, which thou must leave ere long.\\n\\n  lxxiv\\n\\n  but be contented: when that fell arrest\\n  without all bail shall carry me away,\\n  my life hath in this line some interest,\\n  which for memorial still with thee shall stay.\\n  when thou reviewest this, thou dost review\\n  the very part was consecrate to thee:\\n  the earth can have but earth, which is his due;\\n  my spirit is thine, the better part of me:\\n  so then thou hast but lost the dregs of life,\\n  the prey of worms, my body being dead;\\n  the coward conquest of a wretch's knife,\\n  too base of thee to be remembered.\\n    the worth of that is that which it contains,\\n    and that is this, and this with thee remains.\\n\\n  lxxv\\n\\n  so are you to my thoughts as food to life,\\n  or as sweet-season'd showers are to the ground;\\n  and for the peace of you i hold such strife\\n  as 'twixt a miser and his wealth is found.\\n  now proud as an enjoyer, and anon\\n  doubting the filching age will steal his treasure;\\n  now counting best to be with you alone,\\n  then better'd that the world may see my pleasure:\\n  sometime all full with feasting on your sight,\\n  and by and by clean starved for a look;\\n  possessing or pursuing no delight,\\n  save what is had, or must from you be took.\\n    thus do i pine and surfeit day by day,\\n    or gluttoning on all, or all away.\\n\\n  lxxvi\\n\\n  why is my verse so barren of new pride,\\n  so far from variation or quick change?\\n  why with the time do i not glance aside\\n  to new-found methods, and to compounds strange?\\n  why write i still all one, ever the same,\\n  and keep invention in a noted weed,\\n  that every word doth almost tell my name,\\n  showing their birth, and where they did proceed?\\n  o! know sweet love i always write of you,\\n  and you and love are still my argument;\\n  so all my best is dressing old words new,\\n  spending again what is already spent:\\n    for as the sun is daily new and old,\\n    so is my love still telling what is told.\\n\\n  lxxvii\\n\\n  thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,\\n  thy dial how thy precious minutes waste;\\n  these vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear,\\n  and of this book, this learning mayst thou taste.\\n  the wrinkles which thy glass will truly show\\n  of mouthed graves will give thee memory;\\n  thou by thy dial's shady stealth mayst know\\n  time's thievish progress to eternity.\\n  look! what thy memory cannot contain,\\n  commit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find\\n  those children nursed, deliver'd from thy brain,\\n  to take a new acquaintance of thy mind.\\n    these offices, so oft as thou wilt look,\\n    shall profit thee and much enrich thy book.\\n\\n  lxxviii\\n\\n  so oft have i invoked thee for my muse,\\n  and found such fair assistance in my verse\\n  as every alien pen hath got my use\\n  and under thee their poesy disperse.\\n  thine eyes, that taught the dumb on high to sing\\n  and heavy ignorance aloft to fly,\\n  have added feathers to the learned's wing\\n  and given grace a double majesty.\\n  yet be most proud of that which i compile,\\n  whose influence is thine, and born of thee:\\n  in others' works thou dost but mend the style,\\n  and arts with thy sweet graces graced be;\\n    but thou art all my art, and dost advance\\n    as high as learning, my rude ignorance.\\n\\n  lxxix\\n\\n  whilst i alone did call upon thy aid,\\n  my verse alone had all thy gentle grace;\\n  but now my gracious numbers are decay'd,\\n  and my sick muse doth give an other place.\\n  i grant, sweet love, thy lovely argument\\n  deserves the travail of a worthier pen;\\n  yet what of thee thy poet doth invent\\n  he robs thee of, and pays it thee again.\\n  he lends thee virtue, and he stole that word\\n  from thy behaviour; beauty doth he give,\\n  and found it in thy cheek: he can afford\\n  no praise to thee, but what in thee doth live.\\n    then thank him not for that which he doth say,\\n    since what he owes thee, thou thyself dost pay.\\n\\n  lxxx\\n\\n  o! how i faint when i of you do write,\\n  knowing a better spirit doth use your name,\\n  and in the praise thereof spends all his might,\\n  to make me tongue-tied speaking of your fame!\\n  but since your worth--wide as the ocean is,--\\n  the humble as the proudest sail doth bear,\\n  my saucy bark, inferior far to his,\\n  on your broad main doth wilfully appear.\\n  your shallowest help will hold me up afloat,\\n  whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride;\\n  or, being wrack'd, i am a worthless boat,\\n  he of tall building, and of goodly pride:\\n    then if he thrive and i be cast away,\\n    the worst was this,--my love was my decay.\\n\\n  lxxxi\\n\\n  or i shall live your epitaph to make,\\n  or you survive when i in earth am rotten;\\n  from hence your memory death cannot take,\\n  although in me each part will be forgotten.\\n  your name from hence immortal life shall have,\\n  though i, once gone, to all the world must die:\\n  the earth can yield me but a common grave,\\n  when you entombed in men's eyes shall lie.\\n  your monument shall be my gentle verse,\\n  which eyes not yet created shall o'er-read;\\n  and tongues to be, your being shall rehearse,\\n  when all the breathers of this world are dead;\\n    you still shall live,--such virtue hath my pen,--\\n    where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men.\\n\\n  lxxxii\\n\\n  i grant thou wert not married to my muse,\\n  and therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook\\n  the dedicated words which writers use\\n  of their fair subject, blessing every book.\\n  thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue,\\n  finding thy worth a limit past my praise;\\n  and therefore art enforced to seek anew\\n  some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days.\\n  and do so, love; yet when they have devis'd,\\n  what strained touches rhetoric can lend,\\n  thou truly fair, wert truly sympathiz'd\\n  in true plain words, by thy true-telling friend;\\n    and their gross painting might be better us'd\\n    where cheeks need blood; in thee it is abus'd.\\n\\n  lxxxiii\\n\\n  i never saw that you did painting need,\\n  and therefore to your fair no painting set;\\n  i found, or thought i found, you did exceed\\n  that barren tender of a poet's debt:\\n  and therefore have i slept in your report,\\n  that you yourself, being extant, well might show\\n  how far a modern quill doth come too short,\\n  speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow.\\n  this silence for my sin you did impute,\\n  which shall be most my glory being dumb;\\n  for i impair not beauty being mute,\\n  when others would give life, and bring a tomb.\\n    there lives more life in one of your fair eyes\\n    than both your poets can in praise devise.\\n\\n  lxxxiv\\n\\n  who is it that says most, which can say more,\\n  than this rich praise,--that you alone, are you?\\n  in whose confine immured is the store\\n  which should example where your equal grew.\\n  lean penury within that pen doth dwell\\n  that to his subject lends not some small glory;\\n  but he that writes of you, if he can tell\\n  that you are you, so dignifies his story,\\n  let him but copy what in you is writ,\\n  not making worse what nature made so clear,\\n  and such a counterpart shall fame his wit,\\n  making his style admired every where.\\n    you to your beauteous blessings add a curse,\\n    being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse.\\n\\n  lxxxv\\n\\n  my tongue-tied muse in manners holds her still,\\n  while comments of your praise richly compil'd,\\n  reserve their character with golden quill,\\n  and precious phrase by all the muses fil'd.\\n  i think good thoughts, whilst others write good words,\\n  and like unlettered clerk still cry 'amen'\\n  to every hymn that able spirit affords,\\n  in polish'd form of well-refined pen.\\n  hearing you praised, i say ''tis so, 'tis true,'\\n  and to the most of praise add something more;\\n  but that is in my thought, whose love to you,\\n  though words come hindmost, holds his rank before.\\n    then others, for the breath of words respect,\\n    me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.\\n\\n  lxxxvi\\n\\n  was it the proud full sail of his great verse,\\n  bound for the prize of all too precious you,\\n  that did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,\\n  making their tomb the womb wherein they grew?\\n  was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write,\\n  above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?\\n  no, neither he, nor his compeers by night\\n  giving him aid, my verse astonished.\\n  he, nor that affable familiar ghost\\n  which nightly gulls him with intelligence,\\n  as victors of my silence cannot boast;\\n  i was not sick of any fear from thence:\\n    but when your countenance fill'd up his line,\\n    then lacked i matter; that enfeebled mine.\\n\\n  lxxxvii\\n\\n  farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,\\n  and like enough thou know'st thy estimate,\\n  the charter of thy worth gives thee releasing;\\n  my bonds in thee are all determinate.\\n  for how do i hold thee but by thy granting?\\n  and for that riches where is my deserving?\\n  the cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,\\n  and so my patent back again is swerving.\\n  thy self thou gav'st, thy own worth then not knowing,\\n  or me to whom thou gav'st it, else mistaking;\\n  so thy great gift, upon misprision growing,\\n  comes home again, on better judgement making.\\n    thus have i had thee, as a dream doth flatter,\\n    in sleep a king, but waking no such matter.\\n\\n  lxxxviii\\n\\n  when thou shalt be dispos'd to set me light,\\n  and place my merit in the eye of scorn,\\n  upon thy side, against myself i'll fight,\\n  and prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn.\\n  with mine own weakness, being best acquainted,\\n  upon thy part i can set down a story\\n  of faults conceal'd, wherein i am attainted;\\n  that thou in losing me shalt win much glory:\\n  and i by this will be a gainer too;\\n  for bending all my loving thoughts on thee,\\n  the injuries that to myself i do,\\n  doing thee vantage, double-vantage me.\\n    such is my love, to thee i so belong,\\n    that for thy right, myself will bear all wrong.\\n\\n  lxxxix\\n\\n  say that thou didst forsake me for some fault,\\n  and i will comment upon that offence:\\n  speak of my lameness, and i straight will halt,\\n  against thy reasons making no defence.\\n  thou canst not love disgrace me half so ill,\\n  to set a form upon desired change,\\n  as i'll myself disgrace; knowing thy will,\\n  i will acquaintance strangle, and look strange;\\n  be absent from thy walks; and in my tongue\\n  thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell,\\n  lest i, too much profane, should do it wrong,\\n  and haply of our old acquaintance tell.\\n    for thee, against my self i'll vow debate,\\n    for i must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate.\\n\\n  xc\\n\\n  then hate me when thou wilt; if ever, now;\\n  now, while the world is bent my deeds to cross,\\n  join with the spite of fortune, make me bow,\\n  and do not drop in for an after-loss:\\n  ah! do not, when my heart hath 'scap'd this sorrow,\\n  come in the rearward of a conquer'd woe;\\n  give not a windy night a rainy morrow,\\n  to linger out a purpos'd overthrow.\\n  if thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,\\n  when other petty griefs have done their spite,\\n  but in the onset come: so shall i taste\\n  at first the very worst of fortune's might;\\n    and other strains of woe, which now seem woe,\\n    compar'd with loss of thee, will not seem so.\\n\\n  xci\\n\\n  some glory in their birth, some in their skill,\\n  some in their wealth, some in their body's force,\\n  some in their garments though new-fangled ill;\\n  some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse;\\n  and every humour hath his adjunct pleasure,\\n  wherein it finds a joy above the rest:\\n  but these particulars are not my measure,\\n  all these i better in one general best.\\n  thy love is better than high birth to me,\\n  richer than wealth, prouder than garments' costs,\\n  of more delight than hawks and horses be;\\n  and having thee, of all men's pride i boast:\\n    wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take\\n    all this away, and me most wretchcd make.\\n\\n  xcii\\n\\n  but do thy worst to steal thyself away,\\n  for term of life thou art assured mine;\\n  and life no longer than thy love will stay,\\n  for it depends upon that love of thine.\\n  then need i not to fear the worst of wrongs,\\n  when in the least of them my life hath end.\\n  i see a better state to me belongs\\n  than that which on thy humour doth depend:\\n  thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind,\\n  since that my life on thy revolt doth lie.\\n  o! what a happy title do i find,\\n  happy to have thy love, happy to die!\\n    but what's so blessed-fair that fears no blot?\\n    thou mayst be false, and yet i know it not.\\n\\n  xciii\\n\\n  so shall i live, supposing thou art true,\\n  like a deceived husband; so love's face\\n  may still seem love to me, though alter'd new;\\n  thy looks with me, thy heart in other place:\\n  for there can live no hatred in thine eye,\\n  therefore in that i cannot know thy change.\\n  in many's looks, the false heart's history\\n  is writ in moods, and frowns, and wrinkles strange.\\n  but heaven in thy creation did decree\\n  that in thy face sweet love should ever dwell;\\n  whate'er thy thoughts, or thy heart's workings be,\\n  thy looks should nothing thence, but sweetness tell.\\n    how like eve's apple doth thy beauty grow,\\n    if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show!\\n\\n  xciv\\n\\n  they that have power to hurt, and will do none,\\n  that do not do the thing they most do show,\\n  who, moving others, are themselves as stone,\\n  unmoved, cold, and to temptation

summer's flower is to the summer sweet,\\n  though to itself, it only live and die,\\n  but if that flower with base infection meet,\\n  the basest weed outbraves his dignity:\\n    for sweetest

rose,\\n  doth spot the beauty of thy budding name!\\n  o! in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose.\\n  that tongue that tells the story of thy days,\\n  making lascivious comments on thy sport,\\n  cannot dispraise, but in a kind of praise;\\n  naming thy name, blesses an ill report.\\n  o! what a mansion have those vices got\\n  which for their habitation chose out thee,\\n  where beauty's veil doth cover every blot\\n  and all things turns to fair that eyes can see!\\n    take heed, dear heart, of this large privilege;\\n    the hardest knife ill-us'd doth lose his edge.\\n\\n  xcvi\\n\\n  some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness;\\n  some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport;\\n  both grace and faults are lov'd of more and less:\\n  thou mak'st faults graces that to thee resort.\\n  as on the finger of a throned queen\\n  the basest jewel will be well esteem'd,\\n  so are those errors that in thee are seen\\n  to truths translated, and for true things deem'd.\\n  how many lambs might the stern wolf betray,\\n  if like a lamb he could his looks translate!\\n  how many gazers mightst thou lead away,\\n  if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state!\\n    but do not so; i love thee in such sort,\\n    as, thou being mine, mine is thy good report.\\n\\n  xcvii\\n\\n  how like a winter hath my absence been\\n  from thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!\\n  what freezings have i felt, what dark days seen!\\n  what old december's bareness everywhere!\\n  and yet this time removed was summer's time;\\n  the teeming autumn, big with rich increase,\\n  bearing the wanton burden of the prime,\\n  like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease:\\n  yet this abundant issue seem'd to me\\n  but hope of orphans, and unfather'd fruit;\\n  for summer and his pleasures wait on thee,\\n  and, thou away, the very birds are mute:\\n    or, if they sing, 'tis with so dull a cheer,\\n    that leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near.\\n\\n  xcviii\\n\\n  from you have i been absent in the spring,\\n  when proud-pied april, dress'd in all his trim,\\n  hath put a spirit of youth in every thing,\\n  that heavy saturn laugh'd and leap'd with him.\\n  yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell\\n  of different flowers in odour and in hue,\\n  could make me any summer's story tell,\\n  or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew:\\n  nor did i wonder at the lily's white,\\n  nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose;\\n  they were but sweet, but figures of delight,\\n  drawn after you, you pattern of all those.\\n    yet seem'd it winter still, and you away,\\n    as with your shadow i with these did play.\\n\\n  xcix\\n\\n  the forward violet thus did i chide:\\n  sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells,\\n  if not from my love's breath? the purple pride\\n  which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells\\n  in my love's veins thou hast too grossly dy'd.\\n  the lily i condemned for thy hand,\\n  and buds of marjoram had stol'n thy hair;\\n  the roses fearfully on thorns did stand,\\n  one blushing shame, another white despair;\\n  a third, nor red nor white, had stol'n of both,\\n  and to his robbery had annex'd thy breath;\\n  but, for his theft, in pride of all his growth\\n  a vengeful canker eat him up to death.\\n    more flowers i noted, yet i none could see,\\n    but sweet, or colour it had stol'n from thee.\\n\\n  c\\n\\n  where art thou muse that thou forget'st so long,\\n  to speak of that which gives thee all thy might?\\n  spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song,\\n  darkening thy power to lend base subjects light?\\n  return forgetful muse, and straight redeem,\\n  in gentle numbers time so idly spent;\\n  sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem\\n  and gives thy pen both skill and argument.\\n  rise, resty muse, my love's sweet face survey,\\n  if time have any wrinkle graven there;\\n  if any, be a satire to decay,\\n  and make time's spoils despised every where.\\n    give my love fame faster than time wastes life,\\n    so thou prevent'st his scythe and crooked knife.\\n\\n  ci\\n\\n  o truant muse what shall be thy amends\\n  for thy neglect of truth in beauty dy'd?\\n  both truth and beauty on my love depends;\\n  so dost thou too, and therein dignified.\\n  make answer muse: wilt thou not haply say,\\n  'truth needs no colour, with his colour fix'd;\\n  beauty no pencil, beauty's truth to lay;\\n  but best is best, if never intermix'd'?\\n  because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?\\n  excuse not silence so, for't lies in thee\\n  to make him much outlive a gilded tomb\\n  and to be prais'd of ages yet to be.\\n    then do thy office, muse; i teach thee how\\n    to make him seem long hence as he shows now.\\n\\n  cii\\n\\n  my love is strengthen'd, though more weak in seeming;\\n  i love not less, though less the show appear;\\n  that love is merchandiz'd, whose rich esteeming,\\n  the owner's tongue doth publish every where.\\n  our love was new, and then but in the spring,\\n  when i was wont to greet it with my lays;\\n  as philomel in summer's front doth sing,\\n  and stops her pipe in growth of riper days:\\n  not that the summer is less pleasant now\\n  than when her mournful hymns did hush the night,\\n  but that wild music burthens every bough,\\n  and sweets grown common lose their dear delight.\\n    therefore like her, i sometime hold my tongue:\\n    because i would not dull you with my song.\\n\\n  ciii\\n\\n  alack! what poverty my muse brings forth,\\n  that having such a scope to show her pride,\\n  the argument, all bare, is of more worth\\n  than when it hath my added praise beside!\\n  o! blame me not, if i no more can write!\\n  look in your glass, and there appears a face\\n  that over-goes my blunt invention quite,\\n  dulling my lines, and doing me disgrace.\\n  were it not sinful then, striving to mend,\\n  to mar the subject that before was well?\\n  for to no other pass my verses tend\\n  than of your graces and your gifts to tell;\\n    and more, much more, than in my verse can sit,\\n    your own glass shows you when you look in it.\\n\\n  civ\\n\\n  to me, fair friend, you never can be old,\\n  for as you were when first your eye i ey'd,\\n  such seems your beauty still. three winters cold,\\n  have from the forests shook three summers' pride,\\n  three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn'd,\\n  in process of the seasons have i seen,\\n  three april perfumes in three hot junes burn'd,\\n  since first i saw you fresh, which yet are green.\\n  ah! yet doth beauty like a dial-hand,\\n  steal from his figure, and no pace perceiv'd;\\n  so your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand,\\n  hath motion, and mine eye may be deceiv'd:\\n    for fear of which, hear this thou age unbred:\\n    ere you were born was beauty's summer dead.\\n\\n  cv\\n\\n  let not my love be call'd idolatry,\\n  nor my beloved as an idol show,\\n  since all alike my songs and praises be\\n  to one, of one, still such, and ever so.\\n  kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,\\n  still constant in a wondrous excellence;\\n  therefore my verse to constancy confin'd,\\n  one thing expressing, leaves out difference.\\n  'fair, kind, and true,' is all my argument,\\n  'fair, kind, and true,' varying to other words;\\n  and in this change is my invention spent,\\n  three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords.\\n    fair, kind, and true, have often liv'd alone,\\n    which three till now, never kept seat in one.\\n\\n  cvi\\n\\n  when in the chronicle of wasted time\\n  i see descriptions of the fairest wights,\\n  and beauty making beautiful old rime,\\n  in praise of ladies dead and lovely knights,\\n  then, in the blazon of sweet beauty's best,\\n  of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,\\n  i see their antique pen would have express'd\\n  even such a beauty as you master now.\\n  so all their praises are but prophecies\\n  of this our time, all you prefiguring;\\n  and for they looked but with divining eyes,\\n  they had not skill enough your worth to sing:\\n    for we, which now behold these present days,\\n    have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.\\n\\n  cvii\\n\\n  not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul\\n  of the wide world dreaming on things to come,\\n  can yet the lease of my true love control,\\n  supposed as forfeit to a confin'd doom.\\n  the mortal moon hath her eclipse endur'd,\\n  and the sad augurs mock their own presage;\\n  incertainties now crown themselves assur'd,\\n  and peace proclaims olives of endless age.\\n  now with the drops of this most balmy time,\\n  my love looks fresh, and death to me subscribes,\\n  since, spite of him, i'll live in this poor rime,\\n  while he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes:\\n    and thou in this shalt find thy monument,\\n    when tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.\\n\\n  cviii\\n\\n  what's in the brain, that ink may character,\\n  which hath not figur'd to thee my true spirit?\\n  what's new to speak, what now to register,\\n  that may express my love, or thy dear merit?\\n  nothing, sweet boy; but
